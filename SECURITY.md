## Security Policy
For all projects that I am the Maintainer or Author of, if a project has its own separately defined security policy please refer to that instead.

If one of my projects does not have a dedicated Security Policy, please refer to this one.

Failure to follow these policies, if applicable, may lead to being temporarily or permanently banned from contributing to my projects.

### Security Vulnerabilities
If you wish to report a potential security vulnerability please email ``oss@alastair.mozmail.com`` with the subject line of "[Project Name] Potential Security Vulnerability", where [Project Name] is the name of the GitHub project.
Where it is possible to report a security vulnerability privately within the github page of one of my projects, this approach should be used instead.

Regardless of the method used to communicate the vulnerability, please ensure information about the potential vulnerability is contained within the report!

I will attempt to provide acknowledgement of receipt of the report shortly after receiving it/being notified of it. 

It may take a few days to investigate the issue and subsequently decide how to handle the potential vulnerability if is accepted as one.

Whilst a vulnerability is being investigated, please do not publish details about the vulnerability.

### Disclosure of the Vulnerability
A Security Vulnerability affecting one of my projects should not be publicly disclosed until and unless all of the following criteria apply:
1. The security vulnerability has been accepted as being a legitimate vulnerability.
2. The vulnerability has been fixed in an update to the project.
3. The updated version of the project has been distributed and made available to all platforms supported for at least 24 hours at the time of the vulnerability being discovered.
4. At least 24 hours has passed since the updated version of the project has been distributed.
5. The affected versions of the project have been de-listed or marked as containing a security vulnerability.
